Studied US Senator tweets extracted from the Twitter API to analyze the relationship between 'warm' or 'receptive' language and gender/party. 
Data suggests that male-identifying politicians receive favorites from using 'warm' language while female-identifying politicians do not. 
Secondarily, while Democratic politicians garner engagement through 'warm' language, Republican politicans receive engagement through 'negative emotion'.
